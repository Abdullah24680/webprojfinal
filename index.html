            <h3>About Us</h3>

          
                    <p>The growth in the American Pizza market in 1986 was what initially grabbed our attention. 
                    By 1995, Pizza was still the number one growth sector in the fast food industry. 
                    This decade of sustained growth in the U.S.A showed us that we had only realised the tip of the 
                    iceberg in the Irish market and that there was huge potential for growth. The Good Food Company 
                    recognised a service gap in the market for an Irish pizza delivery brand. Apache Pizza was launched 
                    in Dublin in 1996. We wanted a strong name that would reflect the fact that our pizzas are an original 
                    American style, as opposed to the original Italian style pizzas which have a different dough base.</p>

                    <p>Apache Pizza was so named in the spirit of admiration and respect for the indigenous peoples of North and South America. 
                    The etymology of the word Apache is widely believed to have come from the Yuma word for 'fighting men' and the Zuni word 
                    meaning 'enemy'. Apache, by definition, is a collective term for several culturally related groups of Native tribes who 
                    stood up against oppression under the incredible Geronimo.</p>
